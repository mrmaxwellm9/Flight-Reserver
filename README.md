## Features

The flight reserver application allows users to create and log into user accounts, search for flights, book flights with a seat selection, edit their profile, edit their reserved flight seat, and cancel their reserved flights. The application also has an admin account which defaults to username "admin" and password "password" which allows the admin user to create and remove flights and airports for normal users to reserve. The admin account should not reserve flights itself.
